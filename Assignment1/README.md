This is the code for a University project at UiT. It is about a machine learning approach to classify songs into Pop and 
Classical genres using a logistic regression model. We use the Spotify dataset and focus on two key features—liveness 
and loudness—to differentiate between these genres. This report details the data pre-processing steps, the implementation of 
a logistic discrimination classifier using stochastic gradient descent, and the evaluation of the model's performance through accuracy and a confusion matrix.
